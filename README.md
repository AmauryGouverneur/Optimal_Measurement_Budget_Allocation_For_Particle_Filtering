# Optimal_Measurement_Budget_Allocation_For_Particle_Filtering
Particle ﬁltering is a powerful tool for target tracking. When the budget for observations is restricted, it is necessary to reduce the measurements to a limited amount of samples carefully selected. A discrete stochastic nonlinear dynamical system is studied over a ﬁnite time horizon. Only a given number of measurements can be acquired. The problem of selecting the optimal measurement times for particle ﬁltering is formalized as a combinatorial optimization problem. We propose an approximated solution based on the nesting of a genetic algo-rithm, a Monte Carlo algorithm and a particle ﬁlter. Firstly, an example demonstrates that the genetic algorithm outperforms a random trial optimization. Then, the interest of non-regular measurements versus measurements performed at regular time intervals is illustrated and the efﬁciency of our proposed solution is quantiﬁed.
